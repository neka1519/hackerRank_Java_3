//u2028 is Unicode character LINE SEPARATOR
//u2029 is Unicode character PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR
//u0085 is Unicode character NEXT LINE (NEL)
//In Windows, a new line is denoted using “\r\n”, sometimes called a Carriage
 //Return and Line Feed, or CRLF.

//Adding a new line in Java is as simple as including “\n” , “\r”, or “\r\n” at //the end of //our string.
